payment upfront, no trial so no spam. use it in offline or self-host if you want it to be cheaper (probably not)
easiest way to get started is to just mail them an invite link
*and yet,* I cannot shake myself of the feeling that the first 10 MB being free and payment for $18/year for 1 GB is the most user-friendly scheme of it all.
    so what if some people create spam sites? you can probably

== Initial ==
Sign up, 10 MB at first. Upgrade/change plan in the dashboard.
0 USD/year: 10 MB, 1 site
12 USD/year (or 1 USD/month): 1 GB, 3 sites
48 USD/year (or 4 USD/month): 6GB, 10 sites

== Spam lockdown mode ==
Immediately need to pick a plan. The sign up flow has to be rewritten from immediately letting the users in to immediately directing them to a payment page, only after payment will they be let in. If their username is already taken, keep it as null. If the site is already taken, don't create the site and let them create it manually.
12 USD/year (or 1 USD/month): 1 GB, 3 sites
48 USD/year (or 4 USD/month): 6GB, 10 sites

the admin page needs to:
- let me customize the shell script used to flag out bad sites
    - oh: I should be able to write multiple scripts and be given the option to see each of their results. and then it's all deduplicated again in the spam database so each site is only inserted once.
- make sure to include the dates the bad site was created and when it was flagged into the database! this will be useful for analytics in the future.
- for each site flagged out by the shell script, give me a convenient link to browse the site's different pages.
- give me a button to delete a site (this dumps it into a backblaze bucket so that we can use it for future spam data training)
- give me a button to disable a user account
- through it all, all actions must be recorded down so that we know exactly which sites were deleted and who those sites belonged to (again for future data training, but it also lets us link a specific site to a specific object in the backblaze bucket). This means the spam database must be *persistent*!
- show me CDN usage by site (need to communicate with BunnyCDN's API). that's about it, since I doubt many users will trigger this check. if someone does, I can handle it manually first.

TODO: rootdirectory: hide createsite button if the user has already reached their site limit. show the site limit next to the "sites" header.
TODO: changepassword needs to validate against the existing password otherwise password can't be changed.
TODO: for directory.html, for every directory show a new link called 'apply theme' which applies post.html, postlist.html and index.html if they exist.
    - TODO: /applytheme/: needs to check if the current theme folder has any valid template we can apply
        - TODO: the user can also choose between applying the theme for all categories or one specific category.
    - TODO: in site.json, we also need a 'reset theme' option which updates all post.html, postlist.html and index.html to their original format.
        - TODO: /resettheme/: similar to /applytheme/, the user can choose to reset themes for all categories or just one specific category.
I feel like I will regret it if I conflate API sessions and user login sessions
but the primary benefit of making them the same is that the user can manage their own login sessions the same way the manage user API sessions!
TODO: create a sessions table that lets users manage their sessions. They can also generate new sessions, whereby the session token is shown once and then deleted.
    - profile => sessions => generate session token
    - TODO: /profile/ should show the current user's sessions
    - TODO: /createsession/ # notify the user that if they don't supply a label, they will not be able to edit it later on
    - TODO: /deletesession/
    - TODO: this means the authentication table needs a new column called "label", which stores the user agent by default if logging in from the website but is otherwise blank and can be filled in with anything if manually generated by the user.
TODO: allow username to be null, and in the cases where it is null /users/profile/ has to flag it out saying their username is null and needs to be updated ASAP.
    - this allows us to still successfully create a user even if they make a payment but their desired username is not available
    - the worst case is if they successfully pay but the email already exists. in which case we must refund them immediately and ask them to sign up with another email.
TODO: DO WHEN AT HOME INTERNET: no choice, need to switch live back to backblze because only it has the potential to scale past 10,000 customers. we need to take the performance hit.
    - TODO: export all our data, then tear down the existing site data and regenerate it from scratch so that we can seamlessly change users.username from NOT NULL to NULL as well as rename the session table to the flash table and the authentication table to the session table.

DNS testcases:
- Newly created server, no DNS entries configured. Set the cmsdomain to notebrew.com and contentdomain nbrew.io.
    - want: the server starts and listens on :443, but no servers should be provisioned since DNS resolution should have failed for the domains.
    - DONE
- Fresh server, no DNS entries. Set port to 80.
    - (if the user wants to test if their server can connect to the internet)
    - want: the server starts on :80 (no SSL certificates configured) using CMSDomain and ContentDomain set to the server's IP address, and everything behaves as it does on localhost (except without the subdomains).
    - DONE
- Fresh server, with DNS entry set to notebrew.com. Set port to 80, cmsdomain to notebrew.com.
    - (if the user wants to test if their DNS is configured correctly. only one record is required, either an @/A record or an @/AAAA record)
    - want: the server starts on :80 (no SSL certificates configured) CMSDomain and ContentDomain set to the same thing, and everything behaves as it does on localhost (except without the subdomains).
    - you are also no longer able to reach the site using the IP address, must use the domain name.
The main usefulness of being able to run notebrew on plain IP addresses or HTTP is that new users can run it first without worrying about any domain name configuration or SSL certificate configuration and ascertain if they can connect to their server in the first place.

# User tutorials #

- The main guide will be "if you know how to write HTML, just put HTML in these pages and they'll be included"
- The next guide will be "if you want to include CSS and JS and images, create/upload them via the input[type=file] and you can mention it by the name you created/uploaded it with"
- Then "if you want to use templates globally, put them in /themes/ and you can reference these templates everywhere with {{ template "/themes/.../xxx.html" }}
- Follow up with explaining that if you invoke an external template, all the internal templates for that external templates will also be brought into scope. If there are any template name conflicts, the local one wins.
- Then "likewise, if you want to reference images and assets globally, put them in /themes/ and you can reference these assets globally with src='/themes/.../xxx.jpeg' or src='/themes/.../xxx.js'"
- NOTE: need to insert an addenum: sometimes site generation may not be perfect, and miss out something. If you notice anything off, head into site.json and simply hit 'save' to regenerate your entire site from scratch.
- NOTE: inform the user of certain opinionated styles, for example HTML using single quotes instead of double quotes (so that double quotes can be used for HTML template string literals). As well as everything using two-spaced tabs so that it's easy to indent code even on mobile, which doesn't have a tab key and the best way is to hit spacebar twice instead of tab once.
    - Actually if we keep quiet on the opinionated style and mention how to escape double quotes it could also work.
    - Immediately after telling users how to escape double quotes, follow up with why notebrew follows the convention of single quotes in HTML instead of the more common double quotes.
- need to add the concept of permanent files to the guide
    permanent files: notes, pages, posts, output, site.json, pages/index.html, pages/404.html, posts/*/postlist.html, posts/*/post.html, posts/*/postlist.json
    affected actions: rename, cut, delete

# Using notebrew locally (as a static site generator, then push the output to SSG host) #

# Ops tutorial #

self hosting guide, starting from scratch/zero, does not assume any prior server knowledge (just good at following instructions)
step 0: can you purchase a VPS? Can you ssh into it and run commands?
step 1: can you download the binary? this is also how you update notebrew in the future, just redownload it. can it start?
step 2: can you talk to it over the internet using an ip address?
step 3: can you enable user accounts, create the default user and log in using the credentials?
step 4: can you talk to it over the internet using a domain name? (adding DNS records)
    step 4.5a: can you add a wildcard DNS record and connect to the site using www.{contentdomain}? Can you create a new site and connect to it using {siteName}.{contentdomain}? Can you then add a subdomain site?
    step 4.5b: can you add a new DNS record for a completely separate domain and connect to the site using {customDomain}? Can you then add a custom domain site?
step 5: can you talk to it over the internet using a domain name + SSL?
    - Note that it will prompt you to enter your email and stuff.
last step: can you make it run in the background? using start/stop or systemd. other methods like nohup or tmux are possible but if you know those things you probably don't need a tutorial for how to do it.

# Extra ops tutorials #

(for each step, also document how to undo it)
- switch from DirFS to DatabaseFS
    - switch database dialect from SQLite to Postgres or MySQL
    - switch from DirObjectStorage to S3ObjectStorage
- add a separate content domain
- add a CDN and img domain
- add an img cmd
- enable captcha for logins
- enable wildcard certificates using a DNS provider

# Admin tutorials #

admin steps:
- create a new invite (optionally with a site limit and storage limit) and let someone join
- delete existing invites
- generate a password reset link for somebody who has forgotten their password
- create sites
- create users
- assign sites to users (and optionally set the site owner) using the permissions command

notebrew permissions -user $user -site $site -grant -revoke -setowner
