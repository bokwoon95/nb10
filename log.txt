TODO: rewrite main.go such that we generate post.html and postlist.html into /posts/ rather than /output/themes/
TODO: oh my god, every action related to creating a page or deleting a page (that includes copying, moving and renaming pages) has to honor the same system where the outputDir /output/abc/ actually is co-owned by two files, /pages/abc.html and /pages/abc/. If we create files via copying/move/rename, we must copy only the relevant files in the outputDir. If we delete files due to a delete/move/rename, we must only delete the relevant files in the outputDir.
