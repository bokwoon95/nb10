TODO: remove contentSecurityPolicy and contentSecurityPolicyWithCaptcha from the codebase.
TODO: unfortunately it seems uploadfile.go tends to work without a hitch, but file.go doesn't work for adding new images at all.
TODO: ayo why tf can't I add captions to my funny memes?
TODO: pinfile.go: pin/unpin files in a directory. How does it work? With pagination and all?
    - /files/pin?parent=xxxx&name=yyyy
    - /files/pin?parent=xxxx&name=yyyy&unpin
TODO: notebrew config processimg: let users configure a json object that controls how images are processed before being uploaded: then I will be able to upload photoes taken straight from my phone.
    - notebrew config imgcmd 'imgresize'
    - if width/height is less than 0.5625 or 9:16 (i.e. tall image), constrain the width to max 1080p instead of the height.
    - else if width or height is larger than 1080p, take whichever dimension is larger and scale it to 1080p while keeping image dimensions.
    - vipsheader $file -f width
    - vipsheader $file -f height
    - vipsheader resize $file $file_resized $(1080/$value)
TODO: check if a user is able to delete their own site, and if so prevent it
    - They can't, but it's only because of a foreign key constraint. We need to find out where this foreign key constraint is coming from, as well as put our backend own checks to make sure a user cannot delete their own site.
    - We also need to add frontend checks to hide the delete button.
TODO: consider adding a download feature so that I can download my data, wipe the database and reload in case of breaking schema changes.
TODO: convert the "how do I include assets?" and "how do I include alt text?" links to details/summary popups.
TODO: invite.go and resetpassword.go
TODO: remove regenerate.go entirely after the regenerate button is purged from the UI.
TODO: initialize S3ObjectStorage.PurgeCache in main.go. Unfortunately, we will have to do this together with signup.go in out custom main() script.
BUG: can't add new images via file.html image upload "save".
BUG: copying images in a post will result in an invalid link when you click the "3 files copied" link.
BUG: I can't see notebrew.com notes/pages/posts/themes/output, only site.json. I suspect might be permission issue. Fix it.
BUG: Edit notebrew.com's index.html doesn't seem to change its output.
BUG: pasted images into index.html's input seems to work, but saving doesn't seem to upload properly.
BUG: visiting /users/login/ when you're already logged in doesn't indicate that you are already logged in (nor does it prevent you from logging in again).
BUG: can't create a note with the full lorem ipsum text in the file name

BUG: creating a .com site seems to make it empty? Where are my files?
    - Why is my site.json not being created after I createsite? I need to manually navigate to site.json and save in order for the title and description to take effect.
BUG: why is my html lang=''? I thought the default was "en"?
BUG: why does creating a new site keep saying unavailable but then creates everything under the hood correctly? investigate.
BUG: why does initially creating a site result in an invalid title and site description?

DNS testcases:
- Newly created server, no DNS entries configured. Set the cmsdomain to notebrew.com and contentdomain nbrew.io.
    - want: the server starts and listens on :443, but no servers should be provisioned since DNS resolution should have failed for the domains.
- Fresh server, no DNS entries. Set port to 80.
    - want: the server starts on :80 (no SSL certificates configured) using CMSDomain and ContentDomain set to the server's IP address, and everything behaves as it does on localhost (except without the subdomains).
- Fresh server, with DNS entry set to notebrew.com. Set port to 80.
    - want: the server starts on :80 (no SSL certificates configured) CMSDomain and ContentDomain set to the same thing, and everything behaves as it does on localhost (except without the subdomains).
The main usefulness of being able to run notebrew on plain IP addresses or HTTP is that new users can run it first without worrying about any domain name configuration or SSL certificate configuration and ascertain if they can connect to their server in the first place.

should createuser only create a new user?
- exception: if the new user being created is the default user, we also need to create a new site for the default site (if not exists) and assign it site_user and site_owner permissions. That's because we can justify that the default user has natural affinity with the default site, but the relation between users and sites for everything else has to be manually specified
- and deleteuser will not delete the default site, just the user and and site_user and site_owner entries.
- calling deletesite on the default site will delete notes, output, pages and posts. calling any command again will regeneratethe default site so it's fine.

- The main guide will be "if you know how to write HTML, just put HTML in these pages and they'll be included"
- The next guide will be "if you want to include CSS and JS and images, create/upload them via the input[type=file] and you can mention it by the name you created/uploaded it with"
- Then "if you want to use templates globally, put them in /themes/ and you can reference these templates everywhere with {{ template "/themes/.../xxx.html" }}
- Follow up with explaining that if you invoke an external template, all the internal templates for that external templates will also be brought into scope. If there are any template name conflicts, the local one wins.
- Then "likewise, if you want to reference images and assets globally, put them in /themes/ and you can reference these assets globally with src='/themes/.../xxx.jpeg' or src='/themes/.../xxx.js'"
